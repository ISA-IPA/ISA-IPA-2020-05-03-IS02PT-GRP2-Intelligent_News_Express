      "SINGAPORE — Singapore has confirmed 932 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday (May 1), bringing the total number of cases here to 17,101.Of the 932 cases, 11 infections were cases from the community. Five of those cases are Singaporeans or permanent residents while six are work pass holders.The Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a press release that the number of cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 25 cases a day in the week before, to an average of 12 a day in the past week.It added that the number of cases with unknown sources of infection in the community has also decreased, from an average of 16 a day in the week before, to an average of 6 a day in the past week.The bulk of the new cases — 905 of them — are linked to foreign workers residing in the dormitories, while 16 others were linked to those staying outside the dormitories.MOH said it continues to pick up more cases among work permit holders residing in dormitories as it is testing individuals in this group extensively.The health ministry also identified 7 new clusters of infections.They are at Joo Koon Lodge, Tuas South Incineration Plant, 19 Kian Teck Road, 12 Tuas Place, 15 Tuas View Square, 20 Sungei Kadut Avenue and 148 Woodlands Industrial Park E5.CASES IN HEALTHCARE SECTORThe ministry also identified two cases within the public healthcare sector.Both men — identified as Case 15259 and 15700 — are Malaysian nationals who do not have recent travel histories to the affected countries or regions. They were employed as housekeepers at the National University Hospital.They were confirmed to have the infection on April 28.While Case 15700 — a 24-year-old Malaysian man — had not gone to work since the onset of symptoms, Case 15259 — a 28-year-old Malaysian man — had gone to work prior to being admitted to the hospital.UPDATE ON THE REST OF THE CASESIn all, MOH said 1,268 people have fully recovered from the Covid-19 infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, including 24 discharged on Friday.There are currently 1,764 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.Of these, most are in stable condition or improving, and 23 patients are in critical condition under intensive care.MOH said that 14,053 patients are isolated and cared for at community facilities.These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for Covid-19.Sixteen have died from complications due to Covid-19 infection, including a 60-year-old man who died on Friday.MOH said he had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases has reached out to his family.\n",

      "SINGAPORE — The Government is now working on arranging suitable accommodation for recovered workers, as it moves into its third phase to contain the spread of Covid-19 among foreign workers.Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo said at a press conference on Friday (May 1) by the multi-ministry task force handling Singapore’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, that this was necessary to minimise the risk of recurring transmissions.Some recovered workers will be housed in designated blocks in their original dormitories, which will be thoroughly disinfected, while others will be placed in sites such as cruise ships or sports halls as temporary housing arrangements.The Government is also expediting the construction of dormitories that had been planned for before the Covid-19 pandemic and these will help with accommodation arrangements for workers.“Again, this will be an enormous challenge and not just the logistics aspects of it, many workers will be rehoused and they will have to get used to new friends,” said Mrs Teo.She acknowledged that many employers will also have to adjust to their workers being in different locations with new arrangements.In this “recovery” phase, the Government will also look at developing new ways to monitor the health of workers so that “prompt action” can be taken.This will not only be done at dormitories but will also include new arrangements at work sites and elsewhere to ensure workers are kept safe even when they are able to resume work, said Mrs Teo.“It’s critical that we get this phase done well. So that work and business can resume safely when the conditions allow,” she said.Mrs Teo said the first phase of controlling the spread of Covid-19 in dormitories was about “getting the basics right” which included matters relating to food, hygiene, safe distancing and ensuring workers were paid.The second phase was then focused on medical operations and ensuring that infrastructure and medical personnel were built up to implement this.Close to 3,000 staff have been deployed to help with the first two phases and there are now 170 Forward Assurance Support Teams (Fast) in place.These teams have nine officers each from the Singapore Armed Forces, police and Ministry of Manpower to look after issues that workers may have.At non-purpose built dorms, the Government is working with dormitory operators, employers and also with non-governmental organisations to ensure that workers were looked after.Mr Aubeck Kam, Permanent Secretary for Manpower, noted at a media briefing that in some of the factory-converted dormitories, “the physical conditions are actually quite good, and the factory owners do have some additional space where they can repurpose… (and) enable the residents to have a little bit more space to live during this period.”The Government also announced on Friday that it will build Community Care Facilities and Community Recovery Facilities within the most affected dormitories so that workers do not need to wait to be shuttled to such facilities.Community Care Facilities are for patients who are clinically well or display mild symptoms while the Community Recovery Facilities are for patients who no longer require medical care.Singapore Expo, Changi Exhibition Centre and D’Resort NTUC are currently being used as Community Care Facilities while there are 2,000 bed spaces in unused Singapore Armed Forces camps that are being used as Community Recover Facilities.\n",

      "SINGAPORE — Madam Nurul Aisyah, 59, has found herself working on the front lines of viral outbreaks here not once but thrice in her 19 years as a housekeeper at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH).Despite pleas from her family in Malaysia to return home, Mdm Aisyah remains determined to perform her duties and help keep patients safe from the latest outbreak: Covid-19.And while Covid-19 is undoubtedly the most consequential, and has taken a heavy toll around the world, Mdm Aisyah is experiencing a sense of deja vu, to some extent, having seen this sort of emergency twice before.The two previous viral outbreaks of note were the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2003 and H1N1 in 2009. Like Covid-19, Sars was a coronavirus, and though it was less contagious, it was more deadly, with 238 cases and 33 deaths.H1N1, also known as swine flu, infected more than 400,000 people in Singapore over the course of a year, causing 18 deaths.Although many of Mdm Aisyah’s colleagues from the same cleaning company quit their jobs during these crises for fear of catching the various viruses, she has been resolute about not leaving her ward in the lurch.Even when her aged mother and four grown children begged her to return to their Taman Jaya home in Johor Baru after Covid-19 cases in Singapore soared in March, Mdm Aisyah, a Malaysian national, was firm in saying no to their pleas.“My mother called me every day on the phone, crying and begging me to go back. I said, 'Mother, I love you and I will return one day, but now is not the time',” she recounted as her voice wavered with emotion.“If I go back now, my heart feels no good. Who is going to take care of these patients?”The grandmother of four could well choose to retire, since her children, who are aged between 25 and 39, are self-sufficient. She has reasons to return home, too — her 81-year-old mother, who resides in Pahang, has been battling stomach cancer for the past six years.Yet, in times of crises and confusion, Mdm Aisyah’s priorities remained clear: The patients.“During Sars, many of my friends ran away because they were scared. They said to me, ‘Eh, faster lah, let’s go back’. They kept telling me stories to make me afraid, but I was not scared. If everyone runs away, who will be here to care for the patients?” she said.Valiant as she sounds, Mdm Aisyah said she draws confidence from following protocols, such as wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and washing her hands regularly, which has enabled her to survive working in a high-risk environment.“As long as you put on goggles, wash your hands after returning from the patients’ room and follow the steps, nothing will happen. Don’t worry,” she said confidently.For the past 15 years, Mdm Aisyah has been working at SGH’s Ward 48 — designated for cancer patients. She begins her day at 7.30am and toils until 3.45pm. Whenever her supervisor requires assistance, she works overtime until as late as 9.30pm.As a housekeeper, her duty is to keep her ward’s toilets, beds and rooms spick and span. But tending to cancer patients is not an easy feat, she explained, as they have difficulty controlling their bowels.Even during lunchtime, Mdm Aisyah often gets called by patients to help. Once, a patient left a trail of faeces from the toilet to his bed.“I quickly mopped the floor, but after seeing that, I can’t continue eating anymore,” she said.“After I cleaned up, the patient was very happy. He kept saying 'thank you' to me. I felt very good. Whenever patients say 'thank you', I feel like doing more for them.“But after a few minutes, I got called again to do some more wiping. Sometimes, when I think of this, I laugh. Sometimes, I feel very sad. I know they don’t want this to happen,” she explained.Knowing that the patient felt bad, Mdm Aisyah told him that she will attend to him, no matter how many times he calls. To her surprise, he then clasped his palms together and started thanking her in a manner that left her feeling greatly appreciated.“My heart felt so good. I felt that God is arranging everything, for me to be here,” she said.Besides patients, Mdm Aisyah added that it was the rapport she has established with fellow healthcare workers that kept her going.“Sometimes, I work until 9.30pm. However, the (long hours) mean nothing. I want to take care of the patients more, because I know they love me. I work so hard already and for so many hours, but I never think about how difficult it is.“I know the patients, staff nurses and doctors love me. When doctors greet me ‘good morning, Nurul Aisyah’, my heart is so happy. I am just a housekeeper,” she added.Mdm Aisyah then reiterated that this was the reason she could not accede to her family’s request and return to Johor Baru.“I am not scared of Covid, I was also not scared of Sars. Now I don’t want to return because why? Now I have to care for the patients by mopping and cleaning,” she repeated.“If I go now, who will want to take care of the patients?”With the outbreak of Covid-19, Mdm Aisyah has been rostered to clean more often — twice the amount required under her usual schedule.Having to wear the PPE for eight hours a day has also caused her to become more exhausted by the end of the day. Moreover, fasting during the holy month of Ramadan has meant that she has to get up by 5am every day to pray and eat.“Last time, I am not this tired. Nowadays when I go back, I will eat and sleep. Sometimes, when my children call, I cannot answer the phone because I am so tired, but I don’t want to tell them. I am very tired, but I am still not scared,” she said.Since her children are all working adults, with her youngest daughter 25 years old, Mdm Aisyah said she is not working for financial commitments, but out of the desire to serve patients.“I told my patients even if you vomit or (excrete) 10 times, I will come and clean up. Don’t worry, this is our job. Ten times you call me, 10 times I will come.”\n"

      "SINGAPORE — The stay-home notice period for all work permit and S Pass holders in the construction sector will be extended by another two weeks till May 18, as the number of foreign workers not living in dormitories infected by Covid-19 continues to rise.Their dependents will also have to serve the longer stay-home notice, said the Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) in a joint statement on Friday (May 1).The stay-home notice, imposed last month to protect employers and workers from further risk of Covid-19 transmission at construction worksites, was originally slated to end on May 4.It excludes those staying in dorms declared as isolation areas.However, the authorities said on Friday that the prevalence of infected construction workers living outside dorms “remains noticeably higher than the general community”.This suggests that transmission at construction worksites among such workers had occurred before the start of the stay-home notice period and the cases that are now being observed could have been incubated earlier or may have spread among the workers’ close contacts and housemates.Construction workers likely live in shared accommodation and continue interacting with one another unlike most who serve their stay-home notices in isolation, they noted.“Based on the public health assessment by MOH, an extension of the stay-home notice by a further 14 days to cover another incubation cycle will help to break the cycle of transmission,” they added.Employers should arrange for the delivery of food or groceries and other daily essentials, and ensure their workers consult a doctor immediately when unwell, the authorities said.The advisory issued on April 18 — when the stay-home notice was first implemented — to employers on their obligations to their affected workers will continue to apply.Employers whose foreign workers have been approved to carry out essential services during the stay-home notice period can continue with their works, unless the BCA terminates the approval.Foreign workers granted exemptions are allowed to leave their homes only to perform essential activities.“We recognise the impact on affected employers and appreciate their cooperation. Their efforts will help to enable an eventual restart of the sector.“Thus far, the vast majority of employers have looked after their workers well. We will need them to continue doing so for the remaining period of the stay-home notice,” the authorities added in their statement.The Singapore Contractors Association Limited (Scal) is also setting up a Covid-19 fund to help small and medium-sized enterprises during this period and will release details at a later date.\n",

      "SINGAPORE — In order to maintain global supply chains during the Covid-19 pandemic, Singapore will work on guidelines with four other countries to prepare for the resumption of essential cross-border travel.Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing held a video-conference session with trade ministers from Australia, Canada, South Korea and New Zealand on Friday (May 1), where they reaffirmed their commitment to facilitate cross-border flows with each other, the Ministry of Trade and Industry announced in a press release.The ministers also identified concrete actions to help lessen the impact of Covid-19 and will work together on the following:In a speech during the video-conference on Friday, Mr Chan said that the lack of passenger flights has “also affected cargo capacities and led to a disruption in supply chain connectivity for essential goods for many countries”.“These initiatives will not only help us overcome the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, but also position us well for a swift recovery once the situation stabilises,” he said.The ministers endorsed and launched a joint statement based on the one released on March 30 by the Group of 20 major economies, who had agreed to keep their markets open and ensure the continued flow of vital medical supplies, equipment and other essential goods.\n",

      "SINGAPORE — The earnings for home-based businesses are “even more critical\" to those whose spouses have lost their income or jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the businesses — mostly run by women — need all the support they can get to continue, said President Halimah Yacob on Friday (May 1).Home-based businesses have been in the spotlight in recent days after the Government said last week that they must meet certain criteria in order to continue operating during the circuit breaker period or face a S$1,000 fine for a first offence.These businesses can remain open if they only operate online without requiring business owners or workers to leave their homes and do not require customers or third-party delivery services to collect or deliver goods at the residences.As many relied on the current Ramadan period to boost their income, they were hit hard by the announcement.In her Facebook post on Friday, Madam Halimah said that the women who run home-based businesses earn the most during Ramadan, the holy month of fasting for Muslims, in order to pay for their own Hari Raya expenses and for their own personal needs.It is “an important source of income” for them, and going out to work or even working from a central kitchen is “not an easy option” as they have children or elderly and sick parents to take care of, she added.These businesses also provide diversity in food and convenience to working women, she said.“I feel that it’s become an intrinsic part of our food culture. Some home-based businesses subsequently gained enough confidence and managed to convert their cooking to successful catering and restaurant businesses,” she noted.She added: \"I sure hope that many more will be able to make that leap but, in the meantime, they need all the support that they can get to continue with their home-based business.\"She said that she buys her Hari Raya cookies from such businesses every year in order to support them and because they provide the kind of cookies she would “make myself at home if I had the time”.“It’s not the standard commercial cookies that are on sale everywhere but cookies up to your own taste. So in this way, the home-based business meets an important need of many families celebrating their Hari Raya,” she pointed out, adding that she looks forward to buying from home-based businesses after circuit breaker restrictions are lifted.Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli had earlier called out individuals who asked such businesses to pressure the Government into making exceptions for them, referring to such behaviour as “irresponsible”.On Wednesday, however, he said in another Facebook post that he understood the frustrations of such business owners, especially for many Malay-Muslim businesses who have “received many orders” and had their seasonal incomes affected during this period.He added that if the situation improves and community numbers come down soon, such businesses would be able to resume their operations while adhering to safe distancing measures.Mr Masagos also announced ways in which these businesses will be helped through the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SMCCI). Home-based businesses that register through them will automatically qualify for the Temporary Relief Fund.The SMCCI will also collect relevant data from such businesses to better understand the impact of the measures on their income as well as to ascertain how to better support them — be it logistics or business management — during this period and in the long term.\n"

       "u'SINGAPORE \\u2014 The Government is now working on arranging suitable accommodation for recovered workers, as it moves into its third phase to contain the spread of Covid-19 among foreign workers.Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo said at a press conference on Friday (May 1) by the multi-ministry task force handling Singapore\\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, that this was necessary to minimise the risk of recurring transmissions.Some recovered workers will be housed in designated blocks in their original dormitories, which will be thoroughly disinfected, while others will be placed in sites such as cruise ships or sports halls as temporary housing arrangements.The Government is also expediting the construction of dormitories that had been planned for before the Covid-19 pandemic and these will help with accommodation arrangements for workers.\\u201cAgain, this will be an enormous challenge and not just the logistics aspects of it, many workers will be rehoused and they will have to get used to new friends,\\u201d said Mrs Teo.She acknowledged that many employers will also have to adjust to their workers being in different locations with new arrangements.In this \\u201crecovery\\u201d phase, the Government will also look at developing new ways to monitor the health of workers so that \\u201cprompt action\\u201d can be taken.This will not only be done at dormitories but will also include new arrangements at work sites and elsewhere to ensure workers are kept safe even when they are able to resume work, said Mrs Teo.\\u201cIt\\u2019s critical that we get this phase done well.'"
